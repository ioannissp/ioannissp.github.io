Welcome to my website where I showcase my data science projects and skills!

I am Ioannis Spanos, an MSc Statistics student at Imperial College London. I created this page in order to present my data science projects and let other people interact with them, be inspired by them and give me their valuable comments for improvement.

I believe data always have a story to tell, and what's a better way to tell a story than a website? I hope you enjoy your time here!
